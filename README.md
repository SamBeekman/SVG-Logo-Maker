![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Unlicensed-blue)


## Description

This project utilises Node.JS to build a command line interface that will generate you a SVG Logo based on certain parameters. It solves the problem of having to pay a graphic designer to do the work as you simply follow a few prompts and the logo will be generated for you. I learned a lot about npm packages and how to use them and also implemented tests to make sure things were running smoothly.
